physicsString = 'Special relativity is the theory developed by Albert Einstein in 1905 to explain the observed fact that the speed of light is a constant regardless of the direction or velocity of one’s motion. Einstein laid down two simple postulates to explain this strange fact, and, in the process, derived a number of results that are even stranger. According to his theory, time slows down for objects moving at near light speeds, and the objects themselves become shorter and heavier. The wild feat of imagination that is special relativity has since been confirmed by experiment and now plays an important role in astronomical observation. The Michelson-Morley Experiment As we discussed in the chapter on waves, all waves travel through a medium: sound travels through air, ripples travel across water, etc. Near the end of the nineteenth century, physicists were still perplexed as to what sort of medium light travels through. The most popular answer at the time was that there is some sort of invisible ether through which light travels. In 1879, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley made a very precise measurement to determine at what speed the Earth is moving relative to the ether. If the Earth is moving through the ether, they reasoned, the speed of light should be slightly different when hitting the Earth head-on than when hitting the Earth perpendicularly. To their surprise, the speed of light was the same in both directions. For people who believed that light must travel through an ether, the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment was like taking a ride in a boat and discovering that the boat crossed the wave crests at the same rate when it was driving against the waves as when it was driving in the same direction as the waves. No one was sure what to make of the Michelson-Morley experiment until 1905, when Albert Einstein offered the two basic postulates of special relativity and changed forever the way we think about space and time. He asked all sorts of unconventional questions, such as, “What would I see if I were traveling at the speed of light?” and came up with all sorts of unconventional answers that experiment has since more or less confirmed. The Basic Postulates of Special Relativity Special relativity is founded upon two basic postulates, one a holdover from Newtonian mechanics and the other a seeming consequence of the Michelson-Morley experiment. As we shall see, these two postulates combined lead to some pretty counterintuitive results. First Postulate The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. An inertial reference frame is one where Newton’s First Law, the law of inertia, holds. That means that if two reference frames are moving relative to one another at a constant velocity, the laws of physics in one are the same as in the other. You may have experienced this at a train station when the train is moving. Because the train is moving at a slow, steady velocity, it looks from a passenger’s point of view that the station is moving backward, whereas for someone standing on the platform, it looks as if the train is moving forward. Einstein’s first postulate tells us that neither the passenger on the train nor the person on the platform is wrong. It’s just as correct to say that the train is still and the Earth is moving as it is to say that the Earth is still and the train is moving. Any inertial reference frame is as good as any other. Second Postulate The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant— m/s—in every reference frame, regardless of the motion of the observer or the source of the light. This postulate goes against everything we’ve learned about vector addition. According to the principles of vector addition, if I am in a car moving at 20 m/s and collide with a wall, the wall will be moving at 20 m/s relative to me. If I am in a car moving at 20 m/s and collide with a car coming at me at 30 m/s, the other car will be moving at 50 m/s relative to me. By contrast, the second postulate says that, if I’m standing still, I will measure light to be moving at m/s, or c, relative to me, and if I’m moving toward the source of light at one half of the speed of light, I will still observe the light to be moving at c relative to me. By following out the consequences of this postulate—a postulate supported by the Michelson-Morley experiment—we can derive all the peculiar results of special relativity. Time Dilation One of the most famous consequences of relativity is time dilation: time slows down at high speeds. However, it’s important to understand exactly what this means. One of the consequences of the first postulate of special relativity is that there is no such thing as absolute speed: a person on a train is just as correct in saying that the platform is moving backward as a person on the platform is in saying that the train is moving forward. Further, both the person on the train and the person on the platform are in inertial reference frames, meaning that all the laws of physics are totally normal. Two people on a moving train can play table tennis without having to account for the motion of the train. The point of time dilation is that, if you are moving relative to me in a very highspeed train at one-half the speed of light, it will appear to me that time is moving slower on board the train. On board the train, you will feel like time is moving at its normal speed. Further, because you will observe me moving at one-half the speed of light relative to you, you will think time is going more slowly for me. What does this all mean? Time is relative. There is no absolute clock to say whether I am right or you are right. All the observations I make in my reference frame will be totally consistent, and so will yours. We can express time dilation mathematically. If I were carrying a stopwatch and measured a time interval, , you would get a different measure, t, for the amount of time I had the stopwatch running. The relation between these measures is: So suppose I am moving at one-half the speed of light relative to you. If I measure 10 seconds on my stopwatch, you will measure the same time interval to be: This equation has noticeable effects only at near light speeds. The difference between t and is only a factor of . This factor—which comes up so frequently in special relativity that it has been given its own symbol, —is very close to 1 unless v is a significant fraction of c. You don’t observe things on a train moving at a slower rate, since even on the fastest trains in the world, time slows down by only about 0.00005%. Time Dilation and Simultaneity Normally, we would think that if two events occur at the same time, they occur at the same time for all observers, regardless of where they are. However, because time can speed up or slow down depending on your reference frame, two events that may appear simultaneous to one observer may not appear simultaneous to another. In other words, special relativity challenges the idea of absolute simultaneity of events. EXAMPLE A spaceship of alien sports enthusiasts passes by the Earth at a speed of 0.8c, watching the final minute of a basketball game as they zoom by. Though the clock on Earth measures a minute left of play, how long do the aliens think the game lasts? Because the Earth is moving at such a high speed relative to the alien spaceship, time appears to move slower on Earth from the aliens’ vantage point. To be precise, a minute of Earth time seems to last: Length Contraction Not only would you observe time moving more slowly on a train moving relative to you at half the speed of light, you would also observe the train itself becoming shorter. The length of an object, , contracts in the direction of motion to a length when observed from a reference frame moving relative to that object at a speed v. EXAMPLE You measure a train at rest to have a length of 100 m and width of 5 m. When you observe this train traveling at 0.6c (it’s a very fast train), what is its length? What is its width? WHAT IS ITS LENGTH? We can determine the length of the train using the equation above: WHAT IS ITS WIDTH? The width of the train remains at 5 m, since length contraction only works in the direction of motion. Addition of Velocities If you observe a person traveling in a car at 20 m/s, and throwing a baseball out the window in the direction of the car’s motion at a speed of 10 m/s, you will observe the baseball to be moving at 30 m/s. However, things don’t quite work this way at relativistic speeds.'
wwString = "'World War II (1939-1945) was the largest armed conflict in human history. Ranging over six continents and all the world's oceans, the war caused an estimated 50 million military and civilian deaths, including those of 6 million Jews. Global in scale and in its repercussions, World War II created a new world at home and abroad. Among its major results were the beginning of the nuclear era, increased pressure to decolonize the Third World, and the advent of the Cold War. The war also ended America's relative isolation from the rest of the world and resulted in the creation of the United Nations. Domestically, the war ended the Great Depression as hundreds of thousands of people, many of them women, went into the defense industries. At the same time, African Americans made significant strides toward achieving their political, economic and social rights. The roots of World War II, which eventually pitted Germany, Japan, and Italy (the Axis) against the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union (the Allies), lay in the militaristic ideologies and expansionist policies of Nazi Germany, Italy, and Japan. The weak response of the European democracies to fascist aggression and American isolationism allowed the Axis powers to gain the upper hand initially. Although the war began with Nazi Germany's attack on Poland in September 1939, the United States did not enter the war until after the Japanese bombed the American fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. Between those two events, President Franklin Roosevelt worked hard to prepare Americans for a conflict that he regarded as inevitable. In November 1939, he persuaded Congress to repeal the arms embargo provisions of the neutrality law so that arms could be sold to France and Britain. After the fall of France in the spring of June 1940, he pushed for a major military buildup and began providing aid in the form of Lend-Lease to Britain, which now stood alone against the Axis powers. America, he declared, must become the great arsenal of democracy. From then on, America's capacity to produce hundreds of thousands of tanks, airplanes, and ships for itself and its allies proved a crucial factor in Allied success, as did the fierce resistance of the Soviet Union, which had joined the war in June 1941 after being attacked by Germany. The brilliance of America's military leaders, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who planned and led the attack against the Nazis in Western Europe, and General Douglas MacArthur and Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, who led the Allied effort in the Pacific, also contributed to the Allied victory. Among the war's major turning points for the United States were the Battle of Midway (1942), the invasion of Italy (1943), the Allied invasion of France (1944), the battle of Leyte Gulf (1944) and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (1945). The war ended with the Axis powers' unconditional surrender in 1945. Eleanor Roosevelt had played an unprecedented role in the planning and implementation of New Deal programs. Although she was not in a position to take an active role in the day-to-day planning and prosecution of the war, she found other ways to exercise her influence. She served briefly as assistant director of the Office of Civilian Defense, but found that by serving in an official position she created so much controversy that it harmed the agency, and she resigned. At FDR's behest she undertook two major tours, one to Europe (1942) and one to the South Pacific (1943), where she met with Allied servicemen and wartime leaders, providing comfort and boosting morale. Her major concerns, however, were with refugees, the advancement of civil rights and social programs, and the home front. She worked tirelessly to get refugees, especially Jews, out of Europe, encouraging and aiding the work of relief organizations such as the Emergency Rescue Committee and the Children's Crusade for Children, and pushing FDR and other members of his government to do more. Her efforts were often frustrated, but she did not give up and continued to pursue this work after the war when it was easier for refugees to leave Europe. On the home front, she visited defense plants around the country and used her My Day column and speeches to encourage the war effort. She continued to champion civil rights and civil liberties arguing that America could not simultaneously fight racism abroad and tolerate it at home. The painful sacrifices of war would be pointless if America did not achieve equality and justice for all its citizens. Thanks to her efforts, opportunities for African Americans in the military, including opportunities to engage in combat, were expanded significantly. Eleanor Roosevelt was also directly responsible for ending segregation in military recreational areas and transportation services. Together with NAACP Executive Secretary Walter White and African American union leader A. Philip Randolph, she persuaded Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue an executive order in 1941 prohibiting racial discrimination in defense industries and establishing the Fair Employment Practices Commission. Always an advocate for women, Eleanor Roosevelt championed their right to work in war-related industries and strongly encouraged women to do so. She was instrumental in starting social programs such as day-care centers and community laundries to lighten the domestic burdens of the women workers. After the war, Eleanor Roosevelt supported the right of women to remain in their jobs if they depended on their wages. Eleanor Roosevelt also continued to support labor and its right to organize despite opposition from Congress, business, and the public, and her insistence on the importance of postwar planning was reflected in FDR's call for a G.I. Bill of Rights.'"

kareemString = "Hall of Fame basketball center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the NBA's all-time leading scorer. He won six NBA titles, five with the Los Angeles Lakers, over 20 years. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Biography Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was born in New York City in 1947. A dominant high school basketball player, Abdul-Jabbar was recruited to play at UCLA and led the Bruins to three national titles. His dominance continued in the NBA, first for the Milwaukee Bucks, and later the Los Angeles Lakers. Abdul-Jabbar won six titles and six MVP awards, and finished as the league's all-time scorer. He retired in 1989 and is widely considered one of the greatest players in NBA history, and his talent was celebrated as early as high school. Lew Alcindor Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. on April 16, 1947, in New York City. The only son of Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Sr., a New York City policeman, and his wife, Cora, Alcindor was always the tallest kid in his class. Known as Lew Alcindor, by the age of nine he stood an impressive 5'8\", and by the time he hit eighth grade, he'd grown another full foot and could already dunk a basketball. He started playing the sport at an early age. At Power Memorial Academy, Alcindor put together a high school career few could rival. He set New York City school records in scoring and rebounds, while simultaneously leading his team to an astonishing 71 consecutive wins and three straight city titles. In 2000 the National Sports Writers dubbed Alcindor's team \"The #1 High School Team of the Century.\" Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Height Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is 7'2\" tall. John Wooden After graduating in 1965, Alcindor enrolled at the University of California-Los Angeles. There, he continued his unprecedented dominance, becoming the college game's best player. Under legendary coach John Wooden, Alcindor led the Bruins to three national championships from 1967 to 1969 and was named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Tournament's Most Outstanding Player for those years. Milwaukee Bucks In the spring of 1969 the Milwaukee Bucks, in only their second year of existence, selected Alcindor with the first overall pick in the NBA draft. Alcindor quickly adjusted to the pro game. He finished second in the league in scoring and third in rebounding, and was named Rookie of the Year. He also helped dramatically change the fortunes of his franchise. Coming off a dismal 27-win season the year before, the retooled Bucks, with Alcindor manning the basket, improved to 56-26. The following season the Bucks, having added future Hall of Fame guard Oscar Robertson to their roster, made another huge leap. The team finished the regular season 66-16 and then steamrolled through the playoffs, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in the 1971 NBA finals. That same year Alcindor won his first Most Valuable Player award, the first of six MVP honors he received during his long career. Conversion to Islam Shortly after the 1971 season ended, Alcindor converted to Islam and adopted the name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which translates into noble, powerful servant. In 1974, Abdul-Jabbar again led the Bucks to the NBA finals, where the team lost to the Boston Celtics. Los Angeles Lakers Even with all his on-the-court success as a Buck, Abdul-Jabbar struggled to find happiness off the court in his life in Milwaukee. \"Live in Milwaukee?\" he said in an early magazine interview. \"No, I guess you could say I exist in Milwaukee. I am a soldier hired for service and I will perform that service well. Basketball has given me a good life, but this town has nothing to do with my roots. There's no common ground.\" Following the end of the 1975 season, Abdul-Jabbar demanded a trade, requesting Bucks management send him to either New York or Los Angeles. He was eventually shipped west for a package of players, none of whom came close to delivering for Milwaukee what Abdul-Jabbar would give the Lakers. Over the next 15 seasons Abdul-Jabbar turned Los Angeles into a perennial winner. Beginning with the 1979-80 season, when he was paired with rookie point guard Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, the dominant center propelled the Lakers to five league titles. His signature jump shot, the skyhook, came to be an unstoppable offensive weapon for Abdul-Jabbar, and the Lakers enjoyed championship dominance over Julius \"Dr. J\" Erving's Philadelphia 76ers, Larry Bird's Boston Celtics and Isiah Thomas' Detroit Pistons. Hollywood Calls His success on the court led to some acting opportunities. Abdul-Jabbar appeared in several films, including the 1979 martial-arts film Game of Death and the 1980 comedy Airplane! Even as he aged, the health-conscious Abdul-Jabbar remained in remarkable shape. Well into his 30s, he still managed to average more than 20 points a game. By his late 30s, he was still playing around 35 minutes a game. In the 1985 finals against the Boston Celtics, which the Lakers won in six games, the 38-year-old Abdul-Jabbar was named the series MVP. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Stats When Abdul-Jabbar retired in 1989, he was the NBA's all-time leading scorer, with 38,387 points, and became the first NBA player to play for 20 seasons. His career totals included 17,440 rebounds, 3, 189 blocks and 1,560 games. He also broke records for having scored the most points, blocked the most shots and won the most MVP titles in 1989. Years after his retirement, Abdul-Jabbar seemed especially proud about his longevity. The '80s made up for all the abuse I took during the '70s, he told the Orange County Register. I outlived all my critics. By the time I retired, everybody saw me as a venerable institution. Things do change. Post-Playing Life Since his retirement, Abdul-Jabbar hasn't strayed too far from the game he loves, working for the New York Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers. He even spent a year as a coach on the White Mountain Apache reservation in Arizona—an experience that he recorded in the 2000 book A Season on the Reservation. He has written several other books, including 2007's On the Shoulders of Giants, about the Harlem Renaissance. Abdul-Jabbar has also worked as a public speaker and a spokesperson for several products. In 1995 Abdul-Jabbar was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In November 2009 Abdul-Jabbar was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, but his long-term prognosis looked favorable. In February 2011, doctors declared the retired NBA star cancer free. Abdul-Jabbar was named a 2016 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, presented by Barack Obama. A father of five, Abdul-Jabbar has four children from his first marriage to Habiba Abdul-Jabbar and a son from another relationship."
pString = "At this point in the course, we finally enter the twentieth century—Albert Einstein wrote his first paper on relativity in 1905. To put his work in context, let us first review just what is meant by “relativity” in physics. The first example, mentioned in a previous lecture, is what is called “Galilean relativity” and is nothing but Galileo’s perception that by observing the motion of objects, alive or dead, in a closed room there is no way to tell if the room is at rest or is in fact in a boat moving at a steady speed in a fixed direction. (You can tell if the room is accelerating or turning around.) Everything looks the same in a room in steady motion as it does in a room at rest. After Newton formulated his Laws of Motion, describing how bodies move in response to forces and so on, physicists reformulated Galileo’s observation in a slightly more technical, but equivalent, way: they said the laws of physics are the same in a uniformly moving room as they are in a room at rest. In other words, the same force produces the same acceleration, and an object experiencing no force moves at a steady speed in a straight line in either case. Of course, talking in these terms implies that we have clocks and rulers available so that we can actually time the motion of a body over a measured distance, so the physicist envisions the room in question to have calibrations along all the walls, so the position of anything can be measured, and a good clock to time motion. Such a suitably equipped room is called a “frame of reference”—the calibrations on the walls are seen as a frame which you can use to specify the precise position of an object at a given time. (This is the same as a set of “coordinates”.) Anyway, the bottom line is that no amount of measuring of motions of objects in the “frame of reference” will tell you whether this is a frame at rest or one moving at a steady velocity. What exactly do we mean by a frame “at rest” anyway? This seems obvious from our perspective as creatures who live on the surface of the earth—we mean, of course, at rest relative to fixed objects on the earth’s surface. Actually, the earth’s rotation means this isn’t quite a fixed frame, and also the earth is moving in orbit at 18 miles per second. From an astronaut’s point of view, then, a frame fixed relative to the sun might seem more reasonable. But why stop there? We believe the laws of physics are good throughout the universe. Let us consider somewhere in space far from the sun, even far from our galaxy. We would see galaxies in all directions, all moving in different ways. Suppose we now set up a frame of reference and check that Newton’s laws still work. In particular, we check that the First Law holds—that a body experiencing no force moves at a steady speed in a straight line. This First law is often referred to as The Principle of Inertia, and a frame in which it holds is called an Inertial Frame. Then we set up another frame of reference, moving at a steady velocity relative to the first one, and find that Newton’s laws are o.k. in this frame too. The point to notice here is that it is not at all obvious which—if either—of these frames is “at rest”. We can, however, assert that they are both inertial frames, after we’ve checked that in both of them, a body with no forces acting on it moves at a steady speed in a straight line (the speed could be zero). In this situation, Michelson would have said that a frame “at rest” is one at rest relative to the aether. However, his own experiment found motion through the aether to be undetectable, so how would we ever know we were in the right frame? As we mentioned in the last lecture, in the middle of the nineteenth century there was a substantial advance in the understanding of electric and magnetic fields. (In fact, this advance is in large part responsible for the improvement in living standards since that time.) The new understanding was summarized in a set of equations called Maxwell’s equations describing how electric and magnetic fields interact and give rise to each other, just as, two centuries earlier, the new understanding of dynamics was summarized in the set of equations called Newton’s laws. The important thing about Maxwell’s equations for our present purposes is that they predicted waves made up of electric and magnetic fields that moved at 3×108 meters per second, and it was immediately realized that this was no coincidence—light waves must be nothing but waving electric and magnetic fields. (This is now fully established to be the case.) It is worth emphasizing that Maxwell’s work predicted the speed of light from the results of experiments that were not thought at the time they were done to have anything to do with light—experiments on, for example, the strength of electric field produced by waving a magnet. Maxwell was able to deduce a speed for waves like this using methods analogous to those by which earlier scientists had figured out the speed of sound from a knowledge of the density and the springiness of air. Generalizing Galilean Relativity to Include Light: Special Relativity We now come to Einstein’s major insight: the Theory of Special Relativity. It is deceptively simple. Einstein first dusted off Galileo’s discussion of experiments below decks on a uniformly moving ship, and restated it as : The Laws of Physics are the same in all Inertial Frames. Einstein then simply brought this up to date, by pointing out that the Laws of Physics must now include Maxwell’s equations describing electric and magnetic fields as well as Newton’s laws describing motion of masses under gravity and other forces. (Note for experts and the curious: we shall find that Maxwell’s equations are completely unaltered by special relativity, but, as will become clear later, Newton’s Laws do need a bit of readjustment to include special relativistic phenomena. The First Law is still o.k., the Second Law in the form F = ma is not, because we shall find mass varies; we need to equate force to rate of change of momentum (Newton understood that, of course—that’s the way he stated the law!). The Third Law, stated as action equals reaction, no longer holds because if a body moves, its electric field, say, does not readjust instantaneously—a ripple travels outwards at the speed of light. Before the ripple reaches another charged body, the electric forces between the two will be unbalanced. However, the crucial consequence of the Third Law—the conservation of momentum when two bodies interact, still holds. It turns out that the rippling field itself carries momentum, and everything balances.) Demanding that Maxwell’s equations be satisfied in all inertial frames has one major consequence as far as we are concerned. As we stated above, Maxwell’s equations give the speed of light to be 3×108 meters per second. Therefore, demanding that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames implies that the speed of any light wave, measured in any inertial frame, must be 3×108 meters per second. This then is the entire content of the Theory of Special Relativity: the Laws of Physics are the same in any inertial frame, and, in particular, any measurement of the speed of light in any inertial frame will always give 3×108 meters per second. You Really Can’t Tell You’re Moving! Just as Galileo had asserted that observing gnats, fish and dripping bottles, throwing things and generally jumping around would not help you to find out if you were in a room at rest or moving at a steady velocity, Einstein added that no kind of observation at all, even measuring the speed of light across your room to any accuracy you like, would help find out if your room was “really at rest”. This implies, of course, that the concept of being “at rest” is meaningless. If Einstein is right, there is no natural rest-frame in the universe. Naturally, there can be no “aether”, no thin transparent jelly filling space and vibrating with light waves, because if there were, it would provide the natural rest frame, and affect the speed of light as measured in other moving inertial frames as discussed above. So we see the Michelson-Morley experiment was doomed from the start. There never was an aether wind. The light was not slowed down by going “upstream”—light always travels at the same speed, which we shall now call c, c = 3×108 meters per second to save writing it out every time. This now answers the question of what the speed of light, c, is relative to. We already found that it is not like sound, relative to some underlying medium. It is also not like bullets, relative to the source of the light (the discredited emitter theory). Light travels at c relative to the observer, since if the observer sets up an inertial frame (clocks, rulers, etc.) to measure the speed of light he will find it to be c. (We always assume our observers are very competent experimentalists!) Truth and Consequences The Truth we are referring to here is the seemingly innocuous and plausible sounding statement that all inertial frames are as good as each other—the laws of physics are the same in all of them—and so the speed of light is the same in all of them. As we shall soon see, this Special Theory of Relativity has some surprising consequences, which reveal themselves most dramatically when things are moving at relative speeds comparable to the speed of light. Einstein liked to explain his theory using what he called “thought experiments” involving trains and other kinds of transportation moving at these speeds (technically unachievable so far!), and we shall follow his general approach. To begin with, let us consider a simple measurement of the speed of light carried out at the same time in two inertial frames moving at half the speed of light relative to each other. The setup is as follows: on a flat piece of ground, we have a flashlight which emits a blip of light, like a strobe. We have two photocells, devices which click and send a message down a wire when light falls on them. The photocells are placed 10 meters apart in the path of the blip of light, they are somehow wired into a clock so that the time taken by the blip of light to travel from the first photocell to the second, in other words, the time between clicks, can be measured. From this time and the known distance between them, we can easily find the speed of the blip of light. Meanwhile, there is another observer, passing overhead in a spaceship traveling at half the speed of light. She is also equipped with a couple of photocells, placed 10 meters apart on the bottom of her spaceship as shown, and she is able to measure the speed of the same blip of light, relative to her frame of reference (the spaceship). The observer on the spaceship will measure the blip of light to be traveling at c relative to the spaceship, the observer on the ground will measure the same blip to be traveling at c relative to the ground. That is the unavoidable consequence of the Theory of Relativity."
